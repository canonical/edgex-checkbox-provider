# This test validates that the API gateway (aka Kong) is supported by
# the edgexfoundry snap. There are two test scenarios:
# 1. validate that by default a self-signed cert is being used for TLS;
# 2. validate CA-signed TLS certificate can be used for TLS.

# FIXME: The Ireland release no longer initializes an EdgeX CA used to
# sign the TLS certificates for Kong or Vault. As of Ireland, TLS is no
# longer used for connections to Vault per:
#
# https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-docs/blob/master/docs_src/design/adr/security/0015-in-cluster-tls.md
#
# As for Kong, EdgeX now by default relies on a self-signed certificates
# generated by Kong on install for TLS. Production TLS certs can be
# configured using the EdgeX security-config command or via the configure
# hook. Finally, the Kong Admin API has also been locked down so this test
# as written will not work unless the Kong Admin API token is used. In
# theory, it should be possible to just copy this token from $SNAP_DATA for
# use by this script. So this test requires the following changes before it
# can be enabled:
#
# - If Kong Admin API is still used, copy or reference the appropriate token
#   from w/in SNAP_DATA. Another option would be to change this script to use
#   the non-Admin API, however the best solution would be to test both.
#
# - Change this test to ensure that by default a self-signed cert is being
#   used for TLS (i.e. use -k or --insecure to disable verification of peer),
#   again for one or both APIs (i.e. Admin & non-Admin).
#
# - Add test logic to configure a non-self-signed TLS cert for one or both
#   APIs and validate that the correct cert is configured using the same
#   approach as used in Hanoi and earlier versions of this test.
