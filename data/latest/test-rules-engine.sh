# This test validates the rules engine (aka Kuiper) that is supported by
# the edgexfoundry snap. There are four test scenarios:
# 1. when enable/disable Kuiper and ensures that both 
# Kuiper and app-service-configurable are started/stopped;
# 2. ensure Kuiper can create a stream from edgex source;
# 3. ensure Kuiper can create a type of rule with log sink, 
# or a type of rule with MQTT sink;
# 4. validate the operation of stream and rule (status, stop, delete).
